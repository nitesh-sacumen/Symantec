# VipAuthTreeNode
A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's Access Manager 6.0 and above.

## Information

VIP Forgerock offers secondary authentication along with the authentication offered by the openam. Following are the authentication mechanisms available: 1) Push 2) OTP 3)Mobile SDK Registration and Authentication with OpenAM 4)Device Reputation 5)Intelligence Auth Verification

## Installation

The VIP OpenAM tree nodes will be packaged as a jar file using the maven build tool and will be deployed in to the ForgeRock Access Management (AM)6 application WEB-INF/lib folder which is running on tomcat server.

## Steps

1) Configure Maven to be able to access the OpenAM repositories

2) Setup a Maven Project for building the Custom Authentication Node I.e. vip-auth-tree

3) Write the custom logic inside tree nodes to communicate with vip services

4) Change to the root directory of the Maven project of the vip Tree Node Run the mvn package command.

5) The project will generate a .jar file containing our custom nodes I.e . VIP OpenAM Tree Nodes, In the form of vip-auth-tree-1.0.jar.

6) Copy the vip-auth-tree-1.0.jar file to the WEB-INF/lib/ folder where AM is deployed

7) Restart the AM for the new plug-in to become available.

The vip tree nodes are now available in the tree designer to add to authentication trees

Following are the nodes that will be available after deploying the jar file:
